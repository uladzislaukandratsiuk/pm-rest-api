# Creating Spring MVC REST Controller layer

### Spring MVC Framework and REST

Springâ€™s annotation-based MVC framework simplifies the process of creating ```RESTful``` 
web services. The key difference between a traditional **Spring MVC controller** and the 
```RESTful``` web service controller is the way the ```HTTP``` response body is created. While the 
traditional **MVC controller** relies on the **View** technology, the ```RESTful``` web service controller 
simply returns the object and the object data is written directly to the ```HTTP``` response as ```JSON/XML```.

### Spring MVC REST Workflow

The following steps describe a typical **Spring MVC REST** workflow:

   1. The client sends a request to a web service in ```URI``` form.
    
   2. The request is intercepted by the ```DispatcherServlet``` which looks for ```Handler Mappings``` and its type.
   
       - The ```Handler Mappings``` section defined in the application context file tells ```DispatcherServlet``` which 
       strategy to use to find controllers based on the incoming request.
       
       - ```Spring MVC``` supports three different types of mapping request ```URIs``` to controllers: annotation, 
       name conventions, and explicit mappings.
       
   3. Requests are processed by the ```Controller``` and the response is returned to the ```DispatcherServlet``` 
   which then dispatches to the view. 

Spring lets you return data directly from the controller, without looking for a view, using the 
```@ResponseBody``` annotation on a method. Beginning with Version 4.0, this process is simplified even 
further with the introduction of the ```@RestController``` annotation.

### Using the @ResponseBody Annotation

When you use the ```@ResponseBody``` annotation on a method, Spring converts the return 
value and writes it to the ```HTTP``` response automatically. Each method in the Controller 
class must be annotated with ```@ResponseBody```.

#### Behind the Scenes

Spring has a list of ```HttpMessageConverters``` registered in the background. 
The responsibility of the ```HTTPMessageConverter``` is to convert the request body 
to a specific class and back to the response body again, depending on a predefined 
mime type. Every time an issued request hits ```@ResponseBody```, Spring loops through all 
registered ```HTTPMessageConverters``` seeking the first that fits the given mime type and 
class, and then uses it for the actual conversion.

### Using the @RestController Annotation

Spring 4.0 introduced ```@RestController```, a specialized version of the controller which is a convenience 
annotation that does nothing more than add the ```@Controller``` and ```@ResponseBody``` annotations. By annotating 
the controller class with ```@RestController``` annotation, you no longer need to add @ResponseBody to all 
the request mapping methods. The ```@ResponseBody``` annotation is active by default.

#### @RestController example

```java
@RestController
public class TaskRestController {

    private final TaskService taskService;

    public TaskRestController(TaskService taskService) {
        this.taskService = taskService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/tasks")
    public List<Task> getTasks() {
        return taskService.getTasks();
    }

    @GetMapping("/tasks/{taskId}")
    public Optional<Task> getTask(@PathVariable Long taskId) {
        return taskService.getTask(taskId);
    }

    @PostMapping("/tasks")
    public Task addTask(@RequestBody Task task) {
        taskService.saveTask(task);
        return task;
    }

    @PutMapping("/tasks")
    public Task updateTask(@RequestBody Task task) {
        taskService.saveTask(task);
        return task;
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/tasks/{taskId}")
    public String deleteTask(@PathVariable Long taskId) {
        taskService.deleteTask(taskId);
        return "Deleted Task with id=" + taskId;
    }
}
```
